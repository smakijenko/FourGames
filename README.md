# 4Games app
üëã Hi, 

üéÆ I would like to present you my new SwiftUI app with MVVM pattern. It's 4Games, app that consists of four interesting games, accounts system and leaderboard. All backend is handled by Firebase: Authentication, Storage and Firestore. I also used 2 other repositories:

‚ñ´Ô∏è https://github.com/patrickbiel01/Maze-Generation -> to generate random mazes in Maze Solve.

‚ñ´Ô∏è https://github.com/markiv/SwiftUI-Shimmer -> to improve user experience while loading the data.

üü• Here is a link to the youtube video, that shows how the app looks like: https://youtube.com/shorts/0Da7F0Hz_Ec

üëâ All logos and banners are made by myself.

üëâ For icons, I used SF Symbols and a few of them are downloaded from https://www.onlinewebfonts.com

üî• Interesting features that are implemented into the app:

‚óªÔ∏è Signing up/in with email.

‚óªÔ∏è Games:

‚ñ´Ô∏è Kangaroo Run - remake of Chrome Dino Game, with randomly spawned underground icons, ground tiles and obstacles, making the game unique each time.

‚ñ´Ô∏è Words Search - not easy and very often annoying game, only for people, who have an eagle eye.

‚ñ´Ô∏è Maze Solve - as the name suggests, main goal is to find the way out from the maze.

‚ñ´Ô∏è Tower Build - last but not least, remake of my childhood game. Player has to build the tallest tower as possible, making only two mistakes. I implemented gravity into the game, so the feeling of falling block is real.
